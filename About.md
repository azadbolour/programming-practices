# Welcome to the Bay Area Programming Practices Study Group

Our mission is to facilitate collaboration between developers in learning timely 
programming concepts and practices in depth. We do this through reading, hacking, 
pairing, and dialog with fellow programmers.

We study together by meeting from time to time somewhere in the Bay Area, 
by sharing resources through this github repository, and our 
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/programming-practices).

## Group Charter - Version 0.1

Our study sessions are hosted - meaning that one member volunteers to prepare 
for and lead a discussion on a particular topic of interest.

Membership is by invitation only. 

It is natural that some members can commit more time to the such a group's activities than others.
In particular, hosting a session often requires a good amount of preparation time on the part of the host, 
in order to understand the proposed topic area well-enough to effectively guide the discussion. 
Hosts also generally prepare slides or demo code samples to support the discussion.

We distinguish those members who can spend the extra effort to host sessions as sustaining 
members, and afford them extra privileges.

Sustaining members get to vote in group decision making, and they get priority in 
inclusion in sessions where space is limited. Sustaining members also get write access 
as collaborators to this repository.

A topic can be suggested for inclusion in the topic backlog by any member. 
Individual sustaining members can then volunteer to host that topic. 
Finally, topics are chosen for discussion by a vote of all sustaining members.

If you are a member who has attended at least one session, and you are interested 
in becoming a sustaining member, send a message to the group to volunteer 
to host a topic. You become a sustaining member once that topic is voted in 
for discussion, and you have successfully hosted that discussion session.

Sustaining membership continues as long as you volunteer to host sessions 
from time to time, and your suggested sessions are voted in for discussion.

We are looking for a small group of like-minded programmers who are interested
in understanding programming concepts at a deep level. At this time, membership
is by recommendation of an existing group member, or an existing group member's 
direct linkedin connection.
