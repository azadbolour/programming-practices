# Welcome to the Bay Area Programming Practices Study Group

We are a group of developers committed to helping each other learn interesting 
programming concepts and practices in depth. We do this through reading, hacking, 
pairing, and dialog with fellow programmers in small sub-groups.

Sub-groups form organically for the study of specific programming topics by members who
feel strongly about that topic to be able to justify study time for preparation and 
homework related to the topic. Typically a topical sub-group may include 3-6 members,
last for a few months and then disband, and spent a few hours a week in independent
study and meetings. The sub-group may then decide to present their findings to the
rest of the group in a meeting open to all members.

The group as a whole shares resources through this github repository, and our 
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/programming-practices).

## Group Charter - Version 0.1

Our study sessions are hosted - meaning that one or two member volunteer to prepare 
for and lead each session. Different members may host successive sessions of the 
same topic, of coourse.

A topic can be suggested for inclusion in the topic backlog by any member. 
Individual members can then volunteer to host that topic. When enough members
have indicated an interest in spending serious time studying that topic, 
a topical sub-group is formed.

Application for membership to the group is by recommendation of an existing group member, 
or an existing group member's direct connection.

You may apply for membership, attend a few sessions as a guest, and then 
volunteer to host a topic. Membership is contingent on that topic attracting 
enough interest to form a sub-group, and on your successful hosting of at least 
two dicussion sessions.

Membership continues as long as a member volunteers to host sessions from time to time, 
and the suggested sessions are voted in for discussion.

We look forward to having you join us.
